# Portal harness migration

Status: in progress. This document is a migration plan, not installation evidence.

## Observed starting point

PR #6156, baseline `7fcfc531`, contains the existing catalog, source recipe
compiler, scoped proposal channel and host installation coordinator. Preserve
these components, the cloud mascot and current UI during migration.

The local session `516e05c4-558a-4efe-89f0-614317ee0264` demonstrates distinct
failures: the model selected an unavailable installation tool, a follow-up used
ordinary sandbox execution instead of the managed extension flow, and system
Python rejected pip with `externally-managed-environment`. These are model,
integration and environment failures respectively. None establishes a successful
ODS installation. A virtual environment alone would address only the last one.

## Ownership

The model chooses investigative steps, writes integration files, interprets
build errors and revises its implementation. ODS owns execution boundaries,
operation identities, process handles, cancellation, persistence and promotion
into managed Extensions. Neither assistant prose nor a saved recipe is a runtime
receipt. An uncertain operation must be observed before another is dispatched.

Catalog requests reuse existing installation recipes. GitHub requests use an
isolated preparation workspace followed by managed promotion. Preparation may
clone, read, edit, build and test within the granted environment. It must not
silently become an unmanaged installation on the host.

## Migration stages and acceptance evidence

1. **Durable continuation.** Project the authenticated request, bound proposal
   and immutable revision into subsequent turns. Keep user intent distinct from
   persisted facts. A missing draft is an explicit recovery condition, never a
   reason to install another copy. Query actual installation state separately
   from proposal acceptance. Verify owner isolation, cancellation, expiry,
   changed upstream HEAD, missing records and retries after publication.
2. **Preparation workspace.** Bind each preparation workspace to its request and
   expose ordinary file/process tools there. Detect the actual execution host,
   sandbox capability, architecture, available resources and network policy.
   Replace the current blanket GitHub tool prohibition only when this boundary
   is implemented. Preserve normal tools for unrelated user work.
3. **Managed promotion and repair.** Give the agent direct, scoped operations to
   inspect, submit, prepare, advance and observe installations. Infer routing
   identifiers from verified session state where possible. Keep external
   operation identities stable across retries; require a terminal observation
   before replacing a failed recipe. Preserve previous recipe revisions and
   existing data. UI closure must not lose the operation or its result.
4. **Context and skills.** Load relevant ODS integration guidance on demand.
   Keep schemas small and direct. Remove contradictory prompts and obsolete
   phrase-based routing as structured state replaces them. Compaction retains
   operation IDs, current revision, outstanding processes and owner constraints.
5. **Real end-to-end verification.** Exercise both catalog and previously
   uncatalogued repositories, including a library, a web application and a
   project with build dependencies. Include configuration-required, failed
   build/repair, cancellation, reconnect and repeated-request cases. Demonstrate
   actual runtime functionality; importing a Python module proves only import
   readiness, not its inference or application behavior.

## Platform and model contract

Do not change the selected model, context size or GPU backend implicitly.
Support small models through usable tools and informative results, not canned
answers or a promise of identical capability. Existing Linux/WSL and macOS
manager transports must remain supported. Windows-native execution needs its
own supported adapter; a POSIX path is not a Windows implementation. Docker
availability and image architecture are observed prerequisites, not assumptions.

Record actual tested combinations separately. Cross-platform unit tests and CI
are useful but do not prove a local installation on every OS/GPU combination.

## Current evidence

- Repeated accepted proposals recover their immutable receipt without another
  validation/install dispatch; regression tests cover corrupted saved drafts.
- Follow-ups now receive their bound proposal and inspect its accepted commit
  instead of resolving a newer HEAD. Tests cover another owner's conversation
  and a missing/corrupted draft.
- The autonomous preparation workspace, direct managed lifecycle tools, skill
  migration and full real-installation acceptance matrix remain outstanding.
- The existing local 4B failure has not been turned into a verified installation.
- Added `pixel_ods_extension_request_status`: a session-bound read of the saved
  request, verified prepared package and catalog runtime observation through
  the existing Unix manager channel. It performs no lifecycle mutations and
  exposes no credentials or raw application configuration. Unavailable runtime
  observations remain `not_observed`; proposals never imply readiness. API,
  plugin and WSL manager regression checks pass. Local deployment and a direct
  native-tool → Unix manager → HTTP API read succeeded: the previous test
  request correctly reported `expired` and `not_observed`, with no installation
  side effects. This found and fixed a missing internal HTTP route allowance;
  the regression now exercises actual HTTP transport. Real model selection and
  use of the tool remain to be verified.
- After the local environment restarted, WSL services restarted between client
  invocations. A supervised WSL lifetime client keeps this development session
  available. Permanent lifecycle integration for this hybrid Windows/Docker
  Desktop plus WSL-native Portal setup remains outstanding; this temporary
  process does not prove restart persistence.
